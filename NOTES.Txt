No BQ bypass configuration:
Can use internal supervisor inside BQ (VBAT_OK) for BOOST_EN signal
populate R73
unpopulate R60

optionally for VBANK_OK signal for the MCU populate either:
   to use the supervisor as the source of the signal: populate R63 and R62,  unpopulate R61
   to use the VBAT_OK as the source of the signal: populate R61, unpopulate R63, R62.



With BQ bypass, CANNOT use the internal (VBAT_OK) for BOOST_EN signal,
because during the bypass BQ output is disconnected from the main cap,
so it will reach top voltage, and VBAT_OK will go high, BEFORE the
main cap bank charges.




Tested cap config:
Output of output booster (C51,C52,C53): none
Input of output booster (C44,C45): 100uF     (ceramic)
Bank0-internal (C30,C31,C29): 200uF=2x 100uF (ceramic)
Bank0 (C1,C2): none

Tested config:
Use U9 (BU49) supervisor for ON trigger: works  (config chosen, i.e. last tested)
Use VBAT_OK interal supervisor in BQ for ON trigger: works


Issue: zigzag in VDD -- possibly due to the failed-start problem (tune C54,R86 on gate of shutdown FET Q26).
