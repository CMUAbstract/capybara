# HW Design Files for Capybara board

Capybara is an energy-harvesting sensor node that runs on solar panels or RF
energy (from 915MHz RFID transmitters), and features a power system with
reconfigurable energy storage for provisioning energy bursts on demand
([details and link to
paper](https://github.com/CMUAbstract/releases/blob/master/Capybara.md)). The board
includes the following sensors:

* IMU: LSM6DS3
* Magnetometer: HMC5883L
* Proximity/Gesture/Light/Color: APDS-9960
* Barometer: LPS22HB
* Phototransistor
* Analog MEMS microphone
