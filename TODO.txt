BQ VBAT_OK range: 2.5-2.537
R70=100k
R71=3.3M

Deep discharge:
1.6-1.75v doesn't prevent BQ from entering cold start occassionally,
but 1.8v seems reliable.

D25 (VBANK->VSTOR) seems to not make any difference.

Remove TPS22943: it burns massive amounts of current (~130mA for over 1ms),
and keeps burning more as you give more cap on the input of TPS61200.
Everything works without TPS22943.
** TODO: confirm that sensors (particularly, APDS) turn on without killing Vout and operate fine, without TPS22943. 

I think TPS61200 is leaking more than the speced 0.5-2uA. Perhaps
the spec is for when the part is powered but EN=low, not for when
Vin is low (like 0.6V).

Double-start issue, i.e. stray shutdown
change R86 to 1M (still seeing very rare stray shutdown, so perhaps, change C54 to 0.01uF)

v3: include WISP chargepump: S-8823A instead of BQ (as an option)
because BQ cold start is awefully inefficient, especially for RF harvester,
causing the coldstart mode to take 30s+ (under max power) and indefinitely
long for anything weaker.

Find miniumum Cout cap for BQ25504. Datasheet says 100uF, so that is what we
use, but it is very very likely that it will work just fine with a much much
smaller cap, shrinking the cold start time (with BQ bypass enabled) by a lot.

Bank switches:
R=20M to 50M across the latch cap to compensate for leakage into the latch cap through Q4. This leakage causes the
latch cap to charge, even when we want it to stay low (i.e. switch close in NC config).
R8 (replenishment Q4 gate pullup): 1M->100k, to decrease leakage through Q4 (not confirmed that this makes a significant difference)
R4 (replenishment limiter): 47k->10k, because otherwise replenishment is too much for the leakage compensation

Q16 and R16 not needed for Design A (normally closed).

Why P11 (external harvester) male?

V3
---

quick layout fixes:
* Fiducial on bottom
* Remove two 90 degree turns in BLE RF trace
* move ARM JTAG header to the right (towards edge)
* move RF harvester layout downwards (for access to tuning L, C)

fix:
* P1L should go to VBANK instead of VCAP_IN
* zero-ohm on Vbank input to VarTh
* level-shifting FET+R on Vvarth_en to shift from divided Vbank to full Vbank

improvement:
* (potentially) p-FET between latch cap and gate to have enough time to charge the latch cap (when enabling empty banks)

features:
* configurable Vout (2io to analog switch connected to a resistor network?)
** remove U28 charge pump after adding runtime configurable output voltage from the output booster.
* external supervisor for deep discharge (1int pin)
* external Vbottom (i2c+1int) [seems to not have any advantage over using internal comparator]
* radio as I2C slave
* [MAJOR] free up one whole port for camera
** change EDB SW to work with 3 pins
** move analog inputs to former EDB aux pins
** add GPIO expander for power system
